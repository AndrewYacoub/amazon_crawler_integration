Although it's not as new as the recent iPads released in the past year, it is still a pretty good device. The 2020 Apple iPad is excellent because of its features, shipping time, price, and battery life. Some of the many features on the Apple iPad consist of its versatility, such as it can become a mini laptop. It's similar to the Apple iPhone and can do most of the basic things a phone can do, except making a phone call other than facetime. Another feature the iPad has is that, because it's connected to your iCloud account, calls are connected between devices. For example, if someone were to answer a facetime call on their iPhone but soon after the iPhone dies, they can continue to call from their iPad because it's connected via their iCloud. These are just some of the features that the iPad has. The shipping time on this device was average. At first, shipping was only supposed to take a week, but Amazon extended it by a few days, but that was not an issue, as was expected. The iPad arrived in good condition, with no dents or scratches, and it also came with a box and a charger. It was not charged when I received it, so I charged it, and everything worked fine. I bought this iPad for $299. 00. It's not over-priced, and for the quality of this device, it is a pretty good price. The battery life of this iPad is pretty good; it lasts about 2 hours on facetime, and for my sister, who uses it to play games, it also lasts about 2 hours if it's being used non-stop and if I don't use it all day it remains on 100%. It does not die quickly, but it charges slowly. The battery life on this iPad is standard. The 2020 Apple iPad is an excellent device with minor complications that can be handled. But it is a great device because of its features, the shipping time, the price of the iPad, and the battery life.\",\"reviewVotes\":\"11 people found this helpful\",\"reviewVerifiedPurchase\":true,\"reviewCommentCount\":0,\"media\":{\"images\":[],\"video\":\"\"}},{\"reviewerName\":\"Amazon Customer\",\"reviewerLink\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFEW32ZCUETEF73NJQ45FUPZH6A\",\"reviewLink\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R312VXTVXC1O24?ASIN=B08J65DST5\",\"reviewRating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"reviewDate\":\"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021\",\"reviewTitle\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Great Product! - Ignore Neg Reviews as others mention\",\"reviewText\":\"This iPad is absolutely fantastic! I’m an android phone user and have previously used a variety of android tablets (Acer, Samsung Galaxy, etc). I have to say - while I still think android phones are superior to apple iPhones (better hardware specs, better price, more features, etc), the iOS really, really shines on the iPad, and this is by far the best tablet I have ever used! I recently switched my main laptop to a MSI gaming PC, which while great at a desk / workstation, isn’t super portable or great on battery. That was the motivation for purchasing this tablet - to fill the void for simpler, everyday tasks (emails, paying bills, zoom calls, streaming, music, shopping, simple work tasks, etc) on a more portable device with great battery. This iPad does everything it needs to do, isn’t clunky in any way, has exceptional battery life, ample storage, slim form factor, and - for once with an apple product - THE PRICE IS RIGHT! What’s not to love?? If you’re on the fence with this one, just pull the trigger. As other positive reviewers have mentioned, ignore the negative reviews.

Adding the Ipad to the equation for mobility and other tasks on the go seemed like a good idea versus an android-based solution. I originally wanted this product for drawing and quick note-taking, so the price looked great compared to other products which emphasize one or the other. I'll include some pros and con's here to help anyone make up their minds about getting or not getting this product.PROs:1. The screen quality looks great, very crisp with finer details. I don't generally care too much about the pixel count and what generation retina display something is as much as I just care if it looks good. I've never opened an app and wished I was viewing it on my external monitor due to a degrade in quality. It looks great to me.2. Synching between other mac products is pretty simple. While I absolutely hate having to type in username/passwords for everything, this can be solved with a password manager such as LastPass. It was a lot easier to do and now I can view messages from all of my products. This might sound very annoying to some but I have to use slack/Microsoft teams/outlook/etc. for work so it's nice to not miss something just because I'm away from my computer or phone.3. The screen size is perfect for what I'm trying to achieve. I'm not a professional designer or architect but I'm using some apps to help me put some remodeling ideas for my home down. The screen size has felt perfect so far for these apps and even photoshop works similarly to its desktop counterpart. The weight isn't too bad to pick up and walk around with either. Keep in mind I don't have a case for mine (I live on the edge).4. My daughter is 6y/o and I'm able to find a lot of great apps for her on the app store that would be difficult to get the full experience on my iPhone. While I could get her to do this on the MacBook, it's more difficult for her to work the keys and mouse pad in a way that won't draw her focus away from the learning apps that she is playing with.5. The battery life so far is outstanding. While I understand that over time the battery life capacity with the drop to a disgusting degree, at max it lasts me about 2 days on one charge given that I just have regular usage.6. If you get the Pencil (the right one), then it is a great experience. It might take some getting used to if you have not drawn on a screen before as it is not the same as on paper. You don't get the rough friction that you do on paper instead, you're greeted by a gliding feeling as your pencil effortlessly moves about. This can be a plus or a minus depending on your own expectations.7. I like the fact that the charger is not a micro-USB but rather the same kind that the iPhone takes. I'm all for standardizing charging cables as I hate having to have so many for specific devices. They sell some pretty cool magnetic charging thingys that solve this but they're pretty pricy still (usually 2 for $19.99).8. I don't play too many games but I do enjoy a game of league of legends now and then (I'm horrible at it and just play against bots lol). The wild rift game was released for mobile looks and feels and great on the iPad. I've played it on my iPhone and the screen just felt too small to really enjoy it. The iPad size is a good fit though some of the in-game buttons might not be ideal for people with smaller hands.CONS:1. The pencil is great but only if you get the right one. This product will not work with the Pencil 2 which has some enhancements that I wish the first-gen Pencil had *sadness*. I made the mistake of getting the Pencil 2 at first, and while they immediately replaced it for me, it still made me sad to not have the magnetic charging. The synching between the Pencil 1 and the iPad is just very weird.2. The apple store is the most aggravating experience I've ever had with anything. I still have NO clue how I actually managed to sign in or if I even did it right at all. It literally has so much security that I can barely get into my own account. It wants your apple id, password, apple code, some other code, and claims to your firstborn child. This process was by far the most annoying part which took the better portion of my day to accomplish (still not sure if I did it right but it's letting me download and pay for stuff 🤷🏽‍♂️).3. The onboard digital keyboard still feels weird to type on. It's like having an iPhone but with smaller hands, if that makes sense lol. I always hate when I have to type something on it just because of how awkward it feels.4. The fingerprint authentication is kind of annoying, I tend to switch between my left and right hand and often forget I haven't set my left index to unlock it. They still have the regular manual method of unlocking so this isn't a big issue but I'd like an easier way for my daughter to be able to unlock. Face authentication for a family would be nice.5. The camera is kind of horrible when it comes to taking pictures of people. When you're taking pictures of things it looks amazing, but people for some strange reason come out with some odd watercolor-looking effects. If you're hoping to take great pictures I wouldn't suggest this one for that.Conclusion:This is a great product with not a lot to really complain about and many of the improvements needed were done on the later versions of the iPad. I think you get more than what you pay for compared to other tablet solutions. I recommend it if you're just looking for a good tablet to compliment any of your other Apple products.\",\"reviewVotes\":\"18 people found this helpful\",\"reviewVerifiedPurchase\":true,\"reviewCommentCount\":0,\"media\":{\"images\":[],\"video\":\"\"}},{\"reviewerName\":\"Glenda\",\"reviewerLink\":\"\",\"reviewLink\":\"\",\"reviewRating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"reviewDate\":\"Reviewed in Brazil on March 19, 2024\",\"reviewTitle\":\"Excelente!\",\"reviewText\":\"Excelente, mantém a qualidade dos produtos Apple.

Não substitui nenhum dos dois, mas adiciona a questão da mobilidade e do workflow para estudantes e designers.Não sou um adicto em produtos da Apple, o único motivo de ter comprado este produto foi a mobilidade para estudar (faço faculdade ead) e de trabalho, já que a suite parcial da Adobe está disponível no iPad. E não, não é uma versão mobile, o Photoshop e Illustrator realmente são eles mesmos, possuem integridade pela cloud e você consegue utilizar tanto um computador quanto um iPad para trabalhar.Admito que gastei um pouco mais que eu imaginei, 920 da Apple Pencil (um must-have), e uns 100 reais de aplicativos (Procreate e Goodnotes), 130 reais numa capa que abre e fecha da WB, e 80 reais numa película paperlike (uma película que imita papel de uma forma meio esquisita, mas imita bem) também da WB.Tive alguns problemas para configurar, já que a Apple pede para você inserir o cartão antes de poder baixar qualquer app na apple store, mas nem todo tipo de cartão funciona, eles não aceitam débito no Brasil. Problemas chatos de experiência de usuário que talvez seja um pouco mais complicado para uma pessoa leiga em resolver, recomendo buscar qualquer dúvida no google.Para os que trabalham e estudam, o iPad é excelente, possui ótimos aplicativos de organização, anotação e ilustração. O sistema operacional é rápido e 100% funcional, o único problema que eu diria é a bateria, se você estiver utilizando durante 3hrs seguidas ela drena (ótimo tempo para ir dar uma descansada).Para os que buscam diversão, talvez você deva considerar a sua compra, o instagram e o facebook não são otimizados para iPad, como dito, a bateria dura 3hrs seguidas em longa-utilização, e para jogos mobile, eu diria um talvez. Se você deseja comprar para o seu filho/neto e depois queira que ele pare, o tempo de bateria talvez seja o suficiente para durar um dia todo em um tempo razoável de diversão.Resumindo minha opinião, amei o produto. Já estou utilizando em meu dia-a-dia, leio blogs, artigos, estudo, trabalho e às vezes jogo, mas não utilizo minhas redes sociais (para separar produtividade de distrações). Meu workflow já está muito alterado graças ao iPad e pretendo levá-lo onde quer que eu vá.\",\"reviewVotes\":\"One person found this helpful\",\"reviewVerifiedPurchase\":true,\"reviewCommentCount\":0,\"media\":{\"images\":[],\"video\":\"\"}}],\"otherSellers\":[]}}"}

The iPad arrived in good condition, with no dents or scratches, and it also came with a box and a charger. It was not charged when I received it, so I charged it, and everything worked fine. I bought this iPad for $299. 00. It's not over-priced, and for the quality of this device, it is a pretty good price. The battery life of this iPad is pretty good; it lasts about 2 hours on facetime, and for my sister, who uses it to play games, it also lasts about 2 hours if it's being used non-stop and if I don't use it all day it remains on 100%. It does not die quickly, but it charges slowly. The battery life on this iPad is standard. The 2020 Apple iPad is an excellent device with minor complications that can be handled. But it is a great device because of its features, the shipping time, the price of the iPad, and the battery life.\",\"reviewVotes\":\"11 people found this helpful\",\"reviewVerifiedPurchase\":true,\"reviewCommentCount\":0,\"media\":{\"images\":[],\"video\":\"\"}},{\"reviewerName\":\"Amazon Customer\",\"reviewerLink\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFEW32ZCUETEF73NJQ45FUPZH6A\",\"reviewLink\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R312VXTVXC1O24?ASIN=B08J65DST5\",\"reviewRating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"reviewDate\":\"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021\",\"reviewTitle\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Great Product! - Ignore Neg Reviews as others mention\",\"reviewText\":\"This iPad is absolutely fantastic! I’m an android phone user and have previously used a variety of android tablets (Acer, Samsung Galaxy, etc). I have to say - while I still think android phones are superior to apple iPhones (better hardware specs, better price, more features, etc), the iOS really, really shines on the iPad, and this is by far the best tablet I have ever used! I recently switched my main laptop to a MSI gaming PC, which while great at a desk / workstation, isn’t super portable or great on battery. That was the motivation for purchasing this tablet - to fill the void for simpler, everyday tasks (emails, paying bills, zoom calls, streaming, music, shopping, simple work tasks, etc) on a more portable device with great battery. This iPad does everything it needs to do, isn’t clunky in any way, has exceptional battery life, ample storage, slim form factor, and - for once with an apple product - THE PRICE IS RIGHT! What’s not to love?? If you’re on the fence with this one, just pull the trigger. As other positive reviewers have mentioned, ignore the negative reviews. Those folks didn’t seem to read the product description / know what they were buying.

Adding the Ipad to the equation for mobility and other tasks on the go seemed like a good idea versus an android-based solution. I originally wanted this product for drawing and quick note-taking, so the price looked great compared to other products which emphasize one or the other. I'll include some pros and con's here to help anyone make up their minds about getting or not getting this product.PROs:1. The screen quality looks great, very crisp with finer details. I don't generally care too much about the pixel count and what generation retina display something is as much as I just care if it looks good. I've never opened an app and wished I was viewing it on my external monitor due to a degrade in quality. It looks great to me.2. Synching between other mac products is pretty simple. While I absolutely hate having to type in username/passwords for everything, this can be solved with a password manager such as LastPass. It was a lot easier to do and now I can view messages from all of my products. This might sound very annoying to some but I have to use slack/Microsoft teams/outlook/etc. for work so it's nice to not miss something just because I'm away from my computer or phone.3. The screen size is perfect for what I'm trying to achieve. I'm not a professional designer or architect but I'm using some apps to help me put some remodeling ideas for my home down. The screen size has felt perfect so far for these apps and even photoshop works similarly to its desktop counterpart. The weight isn't too bad to pick up and walk around with either. Keep in mind I don't have a case for mine (I live on the edge).4. My daughter is 6y/o and I'm able to find a lot of great apps for her on the app store that would be difficult to get the full experience on my iPhone. While I could get her to do this on the MacBook, it's more difficult for her to work the keys and mouse pad in a way that won't draw her focus away from the learning apps that she is playing with.5. The battery life so far is outstanding. While I understand that over time the battery life capacity with the drop to a disgusting degree, at max it lasts me about 2 days on one charge given that I just have regular usage.6. If you get the Pencil (the right one), then it is a great experience. It might take some getting used to if you have not drawn on a screen before as it is not the same as on paper. You don't get the rough friction that you do on paper instead, you're greeted by a gliding feeling as your pencil effortlessly moves about. This can be a plus or a minus depending on your own expectations.7. I like the fact that the charger is not a micro-USB but rather the same kind that the iPhone takes. I'm all for standardizing charging cables as I hate having to have so many for specific devices. They sell some pretty cool magnetic charging thingys that solve this but they're pretty pricy still (usually 2 for $19.99).8. I don't play too many games but I do enjoy a game of league of legends now and then (I'm horrible at it and just play against bots lol). The wild rift game was released for mobile looks and feels and great on the iPad. I've played it on my iPhone and the screen just felt too small to really enjoy it. The iPad size is a good fit though some of the in-game buttons might not be ideal for people with smaller hands.CONS:1. The pencil is great but only if you get the right one. This product will not work with the Pencil 2 which has some enhancements that I wish the first-gen Pencil had *sadness*. I made the mistake of getting the Pencil 2 at first, and while they immediately replaced it for me, it still made me sad to not have the magnetic charging. The synching between the Pencil 1 and the iPad is just very weird.2. The apple store is the most aggravating experience I've ever had with anything. I still have NO clue how I actually managed to sign in or if I even did it right at all. It literally has so much security that I can barely get into my own account. It wants your apple id, password, apple code, some other code, and claims to your firstborn child. This process was by far the most annoying part which took the better portion of my day to accomplish (still not sure if I did it right but it's letting me download and pay for stuff 🤷🏽‍♂️).3. The onboard digital keyboard still feels weird to type on. It's like having an iPhone but with smaller hands, if that makes sense lol. I always hate when I have to type something on it just because of how awkward it feels.4. The fingerprint authentication is kind of annoying, I tend to switch between my left and right hand and often forget I haven't set my left index to unlock it. They still have the regular manual method of unlocking so this isn't a big issue but I'd like an easier way for my daughter to be able to unlock. Face authentication for a family would be nice.5. The camera is kind of horrible when it comes to taking pictures of people. When you're taking pictures of things it looks amazing, but people for some strange reason come out with some odd watercolor-looking effects. If you're hoping to take great pictures I wouldn't suggest this one for that.Conclusion:This is a great product with not a lot to really complain about and many of the improvements needed were done on the later versions of the iPad. I think you get more than what you pay for compared to other tablet solutions. I recommend it if you're just looking for a good tablet to compliment any of your other Apple products.\",\"reviewVotes\":\"18 people found this helpful\",\"reviewVerifiedPurchase\":true,\"reviewCommentCount\":0,\"media\":{\"images\":[],\"video\":\"\"}},{\"reviewerName\":\"Glenda\",\"reviewerLink\":\"\",\"reviewLink\":\"\",\"reviewRating\":\"5.0 out of 5 stars\",\"reviewDate\":\"Reviewed in Brazil on March 19, 2024\",\"reviewTitle\":\"Excelente!\",\"reviewText\":\"Excelente, mantém a qualidade dos produtos Apple.

Não substitui nenhum dos dois, mas adiciona a questão da mobilidade e do workflow para estudantes e designers.Não sou um adicto em produtos da Apple, o único motivo de ter comprado este produto foi a mobilidade para estudar (faço faculdade ead) e de trabalho, já que a suite parcial da Adobe está disponível no iPad. E não, não é uma versão mobile, o Photoshop e Illustrator realmente são eles mesmos, possuem integridade pela cloud e você consegue utilizar tanto um computador quanto um iPad para trabalhar.Admito que gastei um pouco mais que eu imaginei, 920 da Apple Pencil (um must-have), e uns 100 reais de aplicativos (Procreate e Goodnotes), 130 reais numa capa que abre e fecha da WB, e 80 reais numa película paperlike (uma película que imita papel de uma forma meio esquisita, mas imita bem) também da WB.Tive alguns problemas para configurar, já que a Apple pede para você inserir o cartão antes de poder baixar qualquer app na apple store, mas nem todo tipo de cartão funciona, eles não aceitam débito no Brasil. Problemas chatos de experiência de usuário que talvez seja um pouco mais complicado para uma pessoa leiga em resolver, recomendo buscar qualquer dúvida no google.Para os que trabalham e estudam, o iPad é excelente, possui ótimos aplicativos de organização, anotação e ilustração. O sistema operacional é rápido e 100% funcional, o único problema que eu diria é a bateria, se você estiver utilizando durante 3hrs seguidas ela drena (ótimo tempo para ir dar uma descansada).Para os que buscam diversão, talvez você deva considerar a sua compra, o instagram e o facebook não são otimizados para iPad, como dito, a bateria dura 3hrs seguidas em longa-utilização, e para jogos mobile, eu diria um talvez. Se você deseja comprar para o seu filho/neto e depois queira que ele pare, o tempo de bateria talvez seja o suficiente para durar um dia todo em um tempo razoável de diversão.Resumindo minha opinião, amei o produto. Já estou utilizando em meu dia-a-dia, leio blogs, artigos, estudo, trabalho e às vezes jogo, mas não utilizo minhas redes sociais (para separar produtividade de distrações). Meu workflow já está muito alterado graças ao iPad e pretendo levá-lo onde quer que eu vá.\",\"reviewVotes\":\"One person found this helpful\",\"reviewVerifiedPurchase\":true,\"reviewCommentCount\":0,\"media\":{\"images\":[],\"video\":\"\"}}],\"otherSellers\":[]}}"}
